## Prerequisites
* Node.js 6.x.x or higher
* Python 3.x
* MongoDB

## Simple chatting app using Socket.IO and Node.JS

* This isn't supposed to be a groundbreaking app, this has been done a million times before and definitely have a better implementation than I'll be able to manage.
* It's merely a way for me to learn Node.JS and how to use Web Sockets with Socket.IO
* It may take a while to get an initial version up and running.

## Config

* Define an environment variable **MONGODB_URI** which should contain a URI pointing to your local MongoDB server.
* OR provide the URI as a command-line argument.
* Otherwise there will be a default URI provided - mongodb://localhost:27017/bepis

## Build & Run

```npm start```
